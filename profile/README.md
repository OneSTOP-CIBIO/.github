# OneSTOP-CIBIO/BIOPOLIS GitHub Hub

This repository serves as the main hub for code, data, and tools developed by BIOPOLIS/CIBIO-InBIO within the OneSTOP project an EU-funded initiative aimed at enhancing biosecurity and managing terrestrial invasive alien species (IAS).

## About OneSTOP

OneSTOP (OneBiosecurity Systems and Technology for People, Places and Pathways) is a Horizon Europe project (Grant Agreement No. 101180559) dedicated to pioneering an integrated approach to biosecurity for terrestrial IAS. The project focuses on:

-   **Detection**: Developing innovative methods such as environmental DNA analysis, computer vision, and citizen science initiatives for early IAS detection.

-   **Prioritization**: Implementing data-driven systems to inform management strategies and resource allocation.

-   **Dissemination**: Ensuring that data and tools are accessible to stakeholders for effective decision-making.

-   **Socio-political action**: Enhancing public engagement, policy development, and governance related to IAS management.
